In 2006 NFRIA removed most of the concrete structure, though some pieces were buried deep in the channel as an easy means of bank stabilization. A newly graded bank and river stretch with a riffle-pool-run sequence allows for native and sport fish to thrive in a stretch that was previously occupied by large, non-native carp. Four new rock structures protect banks from erosion, provide habitat for aquatic life, and create fun hydraulics for boaters. The re-graded, re-vegetated floodplain will also allow flood energy to dissipate safely during high water over smooth banks. Seven new willow “silt fences” were planted on either side of the river. These fences stabilize banks with their root structures and trap nutrient-rich sediment during high water.

The property where the dam once stood has since been purchased by The Nature Conservancy and is therefore protected from future development.

Heavy equipment was utilized to batter the concrete structure into smaller pieces, remove the concrete demolition debris, and finally transport the material to a nearby State of Connecticut Wildlife Management Area where there was a large barn foundation hole that needed to be filled in for safety reasons.

Because the dam had outlived its original purpose and was a liability, the owner agreed to remove most of the structure.  The dam was the only blockage on Lopatcong Creek and its removal has opened up 10 miles of additional spawning habitat for American shad and other migratory species.  Benefits of the removal have already begun to be realized.  During the spring floods of 2006, adjacent property and the local Agway store escaped the flooding they have seen in years past.

The dam owners, who operate a restaurant near the dam, donated a parcel of river frontage to be available for public access once the dam, a public safety hazard, is removed. The total project is expected to cost approximately $200,000 with funding provided by federal, state, county, and private partners.

The dam, which had been in place for centuries, had partially breached in 2004 during a rain event.  The pond had been created over 200 years ago to harvest ice, but during a rain event in September 2004, the small dam failed. This project not only restored freshwater wetland habitat and allowed fish access for the first time in centuries, it also allowed for rehabilitation of the park. The remnant dam structure was removed, re-establishing fish passage for the first time in 200 years. Non-native vegetation around the former pond was removed and replanted with native species. This project marks the first dam removal on the New York portion of the Long Island Sound, on Long Island's only north shore river. In addition to the ecological benefits of dam removal, the project provided for park renovation and public education about the park’s habitat. Previously the pond had been fenced off and surrounded by non-native shrubs, which blocked the view of much of the pond.","2010",40.89364,-73.22814,"King's Park","unnamed tributary of the Nissequogue River","","NY","","","prior to 1810","","Ice harvesting","","","","0.4","11/10/2017","",""

The sale included a permanent easement for operating and managing the three dams associated with diverting water to the Mills: Sodom Dam, Shear Dam and Spillway Dam (Spillway Dam is not a fish passage barrier). OPRD intends to go off-line with their demonstration milling water needs and develop a plan for some other mechanism rather than depend on surface water from the diverted Calapooia River flows. This decision by OPRD means that the diversion dams are no longer necessary and these barriers to passage for two ESA threatened species, winter steelhead and spring Chinook, can be addressed. The removal of Shear Dam will also affect the greater Calapooia River's connectivity with its floodplain. It has created a several-mile long backwater in the Calapooia River that has caused sediment to deposit and raise the channel's bed. The Calapooia channel is currently perched at an elevation several feet above the surrounding floodplain, exacerbating local flooding when the river comes out of bank. Every one-year rain event comes out of the Calapooia River banks within the Calapooia/Sodom complex due to the loss of channel capacity. This project is anticipated to alter channel conditions, thus leading to a reduction in flooding from small, frequent storm events.
